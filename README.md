Javascript Paint Program

A javascript paint program I wrote when I was 15. Works best in Google Chrome. Doesn't work in firefox.

<b>Toolbox</b><br/>
It is possible to change between two toolbox tabs; brush and colour. The brush tab allows the brush size to be modified and gives a preview, whereas the colour tab enables a range of standard and personalised hex brush colours to be chosen from. <br/>
